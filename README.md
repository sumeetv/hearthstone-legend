## Hearthstone Legend

This is a basic simulator to let you play around with different win percentages to get an idea of how many games you'll need to play to get to legend. This takes the floors (levels 5, 10, 15, and 20+) into account when losing to provide a more realistic simulation

To run this locally, clone the repository and run 'npm start' in the main directory.

Upcoming Features

- Different win percentages at each level
- Cleaner UI?
